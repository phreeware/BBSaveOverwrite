Overwrite your BB save while being in-game on shadPS4, to reset to a certain game state.


With this tool you get Save backup/restore and archive hotkeys which are active while BBSaveOverwrite is running (minimized in the background) and you are playing BB on shadPS4:

- Overwrite the active shadPS4 save state (while being in BB main menu) from any selected save folder (Load a save backup)

- Backup the current shadPS4 save state to the selected save folder

- Archive the current / a "good" save backup so it can't get overwritten by the tool - Creates a new folder with the current date and time

These can be executed multiple times in any order, which makes for a slightly better save handling than manually copying save folders around while trying to enjoy the game.

Make sure to quit out to the main menu (online/offline selection visible) before loading a save.

A sound will be played when a save has been loaded or backed up successfully.

Supports DualSense hotkeys (can be toggled)


Installation:
Extract and run the exe (from anywhere)
Configure your save folders and hotkeys
Minimize BB Save Overwrite window, start shadPS4 and enjoy :)


Also, download or check/build it yourself on github: https://github.com/phreeware/BBSaveOverwrite 

Have fun!


ToDo's:
- make auto-backup before overwriting a folder
- check that save and archive folders are not the same
