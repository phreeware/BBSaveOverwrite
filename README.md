Overwrite your BB save while being in-game on shadPS4, to reset to a certain game state.


With this tool you get 2 hotkeys which are active while BBSaveOverwrite is running (minimized in the background) and you are playing BB on shadPS4:

ALT+S: Overwrite the active shadPS4 save state (while being in BB main menu) from any selected save folder (source folder)

ALT+SHIFT+S: Reverse overwrite/backup the current shadPS4 save state to the selected save folder (source folder)

These can be executed multiple times in any order, which makes for a slightly better save handling than manually copying save folders around while trying to enjoy the game.

Make sure to quit out to the main menu (online/offline selection visible) before overwriting with ALT+S

A sound will be played when a save has been loaded or backed up successfully.


Installation: just run the .exe (it's 100% safe, fwiw you can run it through www.virustotal.com if you don't trust this)

Disclaimer: I'm a noob at programming so this might not work for everyone, but the tool is 100% working for me on the latest Windows 10 build while running shadPS4
